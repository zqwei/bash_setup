# Format your messages

* Emphasis : * asterisks *
* Strikethrough: ~ tildes ~
* Lists: To create a list, use Shift + Enter to create new lines in your message, then add a number or a bullet (•) before each item.
    * Tip: To add a bullet point (•) from the comfort of your keyboard, try Option 8 on a Mac, or Alt 7 on most Windows machines.
* Blockquotes: Add angle brackets to the beginning of your message to highlight text with an indented blockquote:
    * **>** to blockquote one paragraph
    * **>>>** to blockquote multiple paragraphs
* Code blocks: To display a portion of text as fixed-width code, surround your text with backticks
    * ` single backticks `` display fixed-width text along with your other message text
    * ```triple backticks```` create a block of pre-formatted, fixed-width text
    * Note: Other formatting like bold or italic text will not display in code blocks, and syntax highlighting isn’t supported. For enhanced code sharing, we suggest creating a snippet!
